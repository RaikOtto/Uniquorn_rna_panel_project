Title: Identification of cancer cell lines based on their weighted mutational/ variational fingerprint
Version: 1.0.9
Authors@R: person("Raik", "Otto", email = "raik.otto@hu-berlin.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: This packages enables users to identify cancer cell lines. Cancer cell line 
 misidentification and cross-contamination reprents a significant challenge for 
 cancer researchers. The identification is vital and in the frame of this package based 
 on the locations/ loci of somatic and germline mutations/ variations.
 The input format is vcf/ vcf.gz and the files have to contain a single cancer cell line sample 
 (i.e. a single member/genotype/gt column in the vcf file).
 The implemented method is optimized for the Next-generation whole exome and whole genome DNA-sequencing 
    technology. RNA-seq data is very likely to work as well but hasn't been rigiously tested yet. Panel-seq
    will require manual adjustment of thresholds
